           step 1: identifying the signs <p>
        </h1>
            it might sound <i>obvious</i> but it is important. you don't want to end up mistake someone to be unhappy when they are not.<br>
            <br>
            emotions aren't black and white- it's hard to tell them apart. <br> if you have identified someone around you who isn't feeling too good, good job! <br>
            <br>
            it isn't easy reading the signs either. <br>
            some people hide their depression behind the happiest smiles. <br>
            some people aren't so good at dealing with their emotions- you can <i>feel</i> the despair dripping off of them. <br>
            but hey! it'll be alright, atleast they have you, trying to help them and take care of them! <br>
            here are some changes that can be noticed when someone is having a tough time - <br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>shutting people out.</b> <br>when someone is feeling low, they aren't always good at identifying they need help. they are not good at reaching out. they might try to shut the outside world off. they might try to bear the weight of the world on their shoulders all alone. </li>
                <li><b>lack of interest.</b><br> they might be starting to lose interest in things that used to once excite them. they might start feeling hopeless.</li>
                <li><b>eating and sleeping habits.</b> <br>eating and sleeping habits usually change when someone is feeling the blues.</li>
                <li><span class="urgent"><b> self harm.</b><br>it is very hard to discern when someone hates themself and tries to hurt themself physically. even harder when it is mentally. but if you ever notice someone trying to hurt themselves, <i>get professional help immediately.</i> do <i>not</i> make them feel alienated. usually people who self harm are sensitive and might get triggered by small things. try to be as subtle as you can about suggesting they get help. </span> </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>
                step 2: talk to them
            </h1>
            often, it is the loneliness that makes people sad. <i> talk to them. </i> try to find out why they are unhappy. maybe all they need is a shoulder to lean on. 
            be kind, be nice. don't be negative around them - you never know what triggers someone. <br>
            <h1>
                step 3: oh well...
            </h1>
            there's only so much you can do. if they are not getting good no matter what you do or say, please try to encourage them to get professional help.

<h5> one more moment please...</h5> if you are here, you are here to try and help someone out- i just want to take a moment to point out that - this is really nice of you. :)
