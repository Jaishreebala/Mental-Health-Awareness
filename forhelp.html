            step 3: self care <p>
        </h1>
        sometimes we forget to take care of ourselves. <br>
        here's a tip: <i>don't forget.</i> <br>
        remember to love yourself first. <br>
        a positive mindset can take you a long way. <br>
        it might be hard when you start, but with practice, a positive mind really helps you boost your serotonin. <br>
        some not so conventional tips might be to - <br>
        <ul>
            <li>take a break from social media. <br>social media depression has become a casual term these days. please, try taking a break.</li>
            <li>do not, i repeat- <i> do not</i> listen to sad songs. <br>the songs you listen to influence your mood. don't try to bring yourself down with depressing songs.</li>
            <li>surround yourself with happy people. <br>i know it's a bitter pill to swallow, but if you land yourself in a depressing environment, with unhappy people, the odds are, you aren't gonna end up being any happier than your peers. <br> stay away from those toxic people.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>
            step 4: keep track of your progress <p>
        </h1>
        keep track of what you are doing. ask yourself the questions -<br>
        <ul>
            <li>how did you feel today?</li>
            <li>did you try to remain positive today?</li>
            <li>how well do you think you coped today?</li>
            <li>if you didn't do so well today, what do you think catalysed your unhappiness?</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>
            some general tips... <p>
        </h1>
        <ul>
            <li> this might be a cliche- but <i> do not isolate yourself.</i><br> there's always people out there who care for you. talk to them. <br>
            you are not doing them or yourself any favours by shutting them out.</li>
            <li>keep yourself busy.<br> don't dwell on things for too long. free time = thinking time, and that isn't a great idea when you are not in a good place.</li>
            <li> refrain from self harming practices. <br> it doesn't help. <br> mentally or physically torturing yourself- <i>b a d .</i> <br> repeat this as a mantra in your head: <i>you don't deserve the pain.
                 you deserve happiness. you desereve love. from the people around you. from</i> yourself. <i> never forget that.</i></li>
            <li>if nothing helps- it is strongly recommended to get some prefessional help. therapists- they <i>know</i> what they are doing. </li>

        </ul>

        <h3>apart from all this- <br>
        just know that you are <i>not alone.</i></h3>
        things <i> will </i> get better. <br>
        hold on for a bit longer- you are strong enough :)
